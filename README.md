# SeatAssignment
**Hello! Glad you made it!**

**I am providing a walkthrough of my code below.**



**DECLARATIONS AND INITIALIZING VECTORS**

In the beginning of my code, I used vectors to be able to have the rows mapped out. Within the for loop, I added values 1-20 to each vector to account for the amount of seats in each row.

**Output file**

Below is the output of my program to a CSV file. I used my own input file as shown at the beginning for example.
